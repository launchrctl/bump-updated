# plasmactl-bump

Update the version of components that were updated in the last commit.

### Excluded Files:

- README.md
- README.svg

---

**bump:** Updates the version of components that were modified after the last bump.

### Bump flow

1. Open the git repository.
2. Check if the latest commit is not a bump commit.
3. Collect a list of changed (new, updated, deleted) files until the previous bump commit is found (matching by author).
   If the `last` option is
   passed, only take changes from the last commit. Prepare a map of resource objects to update.
4. Get the short hash of the last commit.
5. Iterate through the resource map and update the version of each.

### `bump --sync` or Propagation

`bump` works closely with `plasmactl compose`. The purpose of `compose` is to build the platform using resources from
different places (domain repo, packages outside the repo).
The purpose of `bump --sync` is to propagate the versions of changed resources to dependant resources in current build (
post composition) using git history of repositories.

### Overall Propagation Workflow:

- Initialize inventory. Which includes calculating variables and resources dependencies.
- Identify list of resources which version should be propagated.
- Build propagation map.
- Update resources in build dir according propagation map.

#### Prerequisites:

- It is important to use `bump --sync` after a fresh `compose`. Otherwise, an incorrect result or error may occur.

### Detailed Propagation Workflow:

1. **Search and download the artifact to compare the build to:**

- Prepare list of resources names per namespace (domain + packages names), if resource exists in several sources,
  identify origin of composed resource and remove duplicates,
  see [Syncing Resource Versions Across Namespaces](#syncing-resource-versions-across-sources)
- Find all variables which include other variables in their values, store these dependencies in special map.
- Find all usage of variables in resources files (template, configuration files), store usage of each dependency in
  special map.

2.**Identify list of resources which version should be propagated:**

* Initialize [timeline](#timeline).
* Iterate through all resources (domain + packages) and populate timeline,
  * Iterate git history to find latest commit where version for resource was set.
  * If resource has non-versioned changes, error will be returned, unless `allow-override` options passed.
* Iterate through all variables in build dir and populate timeline with variables versions.
  * Iterate git history to find latest commit where value for variable was set.
  * If build variable value is different from committed value, error will be returned, unless `allow-override` options
      passed.

#### Resource criteria

- resource should have `meta/plasma.yaml` file
- resource filepath should match path `%platform/%kind/roles/%name/`

where `kind` is one of:

- `applications`
- `services`
- `softwares`
- `executors`
- `flows`
- `skills`
- `functions`
- `libraries`
- `entities`

#### Syncing Resource Versions Across Sources:

Before propagation, resources are gathered in maps per namespace. Static namespace `domain` and N namespaces
per number of packages, each of them stored by package name. Packages come from `plasma-compose.yaml`.
Resources that exist in multiple namespaces are filtered to have 1 resource in domain or package.
`compose` handles this via merge strategies, but `sync` compares the build version with the namespace versions to select
the correct resource.

> @TODO: Temporary solution, better handling of compose merge strategies should be implemented.

Resources are filtered by rule:

- Find build version of resource;
- Find resource in namespaces that match the same version;
- If several resources found by the same name, latest package is prioritized between packages, but domain namespace is
  prioritized over packages.

#### Timeline

To propagate, we first search for the commit where the resource version was set. This commit is added to a special list
of objects called timeline.
Each timeline object contains the commit date, a list of variables to propagate, or a list of resources.
The timeline is sorted by date to maintain the correct version sequence as if propagation was applied after each change.

Iterating through the timeline (chronologically sorted) and applying dependent resource versions, the latest state
is achieved.

3**Build propagation map:**

- Chronologically sort timeline.
- Iterate each timeline entry.
- If entry has resources or variables, find list of dependent resources and store for each of them version of timeline
  entry (propagate).
- If resource existed in propagation map, it will be overridden by next timeline entry version.

4**Update resources in build dir:**

- Iterate each resource in propagation map.
- Build new version for resource, which consists of resource original and propagated versions, final result will look
  like `resource_version-propagated_version`.
- Update each resource meta to store new version.
- If the resource version matches the propagation map, itâ€™s skipped (happens in case when both parent and child
  resources were bumped. No need to propagate parent version to child if they already have identical new version).

---

### Acceptance criteria

#### Case 1: propagation with no changes

As a developer:

- Clone an existing git repo.
- Make an empty commit.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned` to prepare the build.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync` to propagate versions of updated resources to dependent resources.

**Expected Outcome:**  
No bumping occurs because no resource was updated. No propagation occurs because there is no difference between current
build and comparison artifact.
However, all propagated versions from the artifact should be copied to current build if the base version doesn't match
between the build and artifact.

---

#### Case 2: Updated resources in domain or package repo

As a developer:

- Update an existing resource in domain/package repo (e.g., change a template, task, dependency).
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync` to propagate the new version to dependent resources.

**Expected Outcome:**  
The new version from the bump (e.g., 1111111111111) should propagate to all dependent resources
as `resource_version-1111111111111`.

---

#### Case 3: Removed resources in domain/package repo

As a developer:

- Remove a resource.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync` to propagate the changes.

**Expected Outcome:**  
No bumping or propagation. The developer should manually remove any dependencies before the bump.

---

#### Case 4: Added resources in domain/package repo

As a developer:

- Add a new resource.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync`.

**Expected Outcome:**  
The new resource is bumped, but nothing else is propagated. Propagation occurs if the resource is overridden from
another namespace (e.g., domain or package).

#### Case 5: Updated variable in an existing group_vars/vault in domain repo

As a developer:

- Update a variable in `group_vars` or `vault.yaml`.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.

**Expected Outcome:**  
No bumping occurs, but the variable change should propagate to all dependent resources, using commit where change
happened.

---

#### Case 6:  Removed variable in an existing group_vars/vault in domain repo

As a developer:

- Update a variable in `group_vars` or `vault.yaml`.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync`.

**Expected Outcome:**  
No bumping occurs, but the variable change should propagate to all dependent resources, using commit where change
happened.

---

#### Case 7: Added variable in an existing group_vars/vault in domain repo

As a developer:

- Update a variable in `group_vars` or `vault.yaml`.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync`.

**Expected Outcome:**  
No bumping occurs, but the variable change should propagate to all dependent resources, using commit where change
happened.

---

#### Case 8: Added group_vars/vault file in domain repo

As a developer:

- Create `group_vars` or `vault.yaml` files.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync`.

**Expected Outcome:**  
No bumping, but the file creation commit should be propagated to dependent resources of each variable in new file.

---

#### Case 9: Removed group_vars/vault file in domain repo

As a developer:

- Remove `group_vars` or `vault.yaml` files.
- Run `plasmactl bump` to update the resource version during developments.
- Run `plasmactl compose --conflicts-verbosity --skip-not-versioned`.
- Run `plasmactl bump --sync`.
